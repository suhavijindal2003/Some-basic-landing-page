    <h3>Celebrate Child Labour Day by putting a full stop to child laboring.</h3>
    <p>Many campaigns have been organised in recent years to oppose the employment of children in mines, factories, motor garages, restaurants, tea stalls, and shops. There are many households that employ poor children, but only a few provide adequate food and clothing to their child servants. They are denied an education because their wages are paid to their parents and are rarely spent on them. The children are forced to work at such a young age due to their parentsâ€™ extreme poverty. To reduce poverty, we need not only strict laws but also comprehensive economic reform.</p>
